# JavaMoneroGUI

Java Monero Wallet GUI

Aims to bring another Monero GUI solution into the fray

## Develop
In order to develop, these libraries will be needed:

imgui.jar (https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui)

log4j-api.jar

log4j-core.jar

log4j-iostreams.jar (https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).

Hopefully I'll learn how to use Gradle soon.


The project uses Kotlin as a programming language.

How to add Kotlin support to Eclipse:
Help > Eclipse Marketplace. Search "kotlin", add the one from JetBrains.
